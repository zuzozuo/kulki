My school project. Based on old polish puzzle game from '95 developed by Jaros≈Çaw Lewandowski.

##Instructions
*Open index.html in your browser. 
*Click on the circle and chose place for it.
(you can only place it in empty cell)
*The goal of the game is to place cicles of the same color in one line
(vercitcal, horizontal or diagonal, at least 5!)
*If you line (at least) 5 circles of the same color, they disappear and you get the points,
otherwise 3 new circles appear in random empty cells.
*Game ends when all cells are taken

##Build with
* *JavaScript* 
* *HTML5*
* *CSS3*
